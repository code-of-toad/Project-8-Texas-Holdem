Texas Hold'em Poker Q&A:
------------------------

Q: How many hole cards are dealt to each player in Texas Hold'em?
A: Each player is dealt two private hole cards.

Q: What are the betting rounds in Texas Hold'em?
A: Pre-flop, Flop, Turn, and River.

Q: What's the difference between "No Limit", "Pot Limit", and "Limit" Hold'em?
A: - "No Limit": Players can bet any amount, up to all their chips.
   - "Pot Limit": Maximum bet is the current pot size.
   - "Limit": Bets and raises are of a fixed amount.

Q: What is a "blinds" in poker?
A: Forced bets posted by players to the left of the dealer button. Includes "small blind" and "big blind".

Q: What is the "button" in poker?
A: A marker indicating the nominal dealer. It rotates clockwise after each hand.

Q: What does "All-in" mean?
A: A player bets all their remaining chips.

Q: What is a "community card"?
A: Cards placed face-up in the center, shared by all players to form their best hand.

Q: What happens when multiple players go "All-in"?
A: The pot is split into main and side pots. Players can only win from players they've covered in chips.

Q: What is a "kicker" in poker?
A: An unpaired card used to determine the winner between two similar hands.

Q: What is the "burn card"?
A: A card discarded from the top of the deck before dealing community cards.

Q: How is the winner determined in Texas Hold'em?
A: The player with the best five-card hand or the last player remaining after all others have folded.

Q: What is a "called player" in poker?
A: A player who has matched a bet/raise.

Q: What is an "aggresive player" in poker?
A: The player who initiated the last bet/raise.

Q: In the showdown, does the aggressor have the option to not show his cards?
A: Yes. If no one calls the last aggressor's bet, the aggressor can choose to
   muck (not show) their hand and still win the pot. If called, they must show.

Q: If the winner is determined before the showdown, must the winner reveal his
   cards?
A: No. If all players fold to a bet or raise, the winner can choose to muck
   their hand without revealing it.

Note: This is a basic list, and there are many more specific and nuanced questions players might have about Texas Hold'em.

    __Dev Game Plan:
    ----------------
    - Played thru console I/O.
    - By default, 

    Hold'em Rules:
    --------------
    1. The turn order moves in the clockwise direction.
    2. In "self-deal" games, the dealer button moves from hand to hand, to each
    player, to whom it assigns the dealer duty for the hand about to begin.
    3. In a cash game, the small blind bets $1, and the big blind bets $2.
    4. In the first betting round, the first raise must be at least twice the
    minimum bet. Note: after the first raise, each subsequent player's call
    size is the most recent amount raised, and no longer the minimum bet.
    5. Starting from the second betting round, the turn order now starts from
    the player to the left of the dealer. Also, players can now "check" as long
    as the bet has not been raised by anyone. However, if the bet is raised,
    the three player options boil back down to "call", "raise", or "fold".


    Hold'em Terms:
    --------------
     - Hand: the best combination of five out of the seven total cards a
             player can claim.
     - Hole cards: private cards owned by all players.
     - Board: area in which five community cards lay.
     - Aggressor: the player who initiated the last bet/raise.
